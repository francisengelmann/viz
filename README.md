Inspired by the functionality of the famouse PCL (Pointcloud Library),
VIZ tries to be a more lightweight visualiation library that comes without a large list of dependencies.
Its only required dependencies are VTK and Eigen. If desired, it can also output rendered views into OpenCV.

# Motivation
Visualizations are en essantial part of debugging computer vision code.
Hence, it should be as easy and as convenient as possible.

# Installation
Usual cmake installation is provided


# Standards
* Coordinate sytem orientation
* Color scaling and type: always in 0..255
